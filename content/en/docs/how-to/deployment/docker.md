## Requirements

- Working project â€” check that your project works locally
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on local computer â€” latest LTS version or newer
- [Skulljs-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@skulljs/cli) on local computer â€” the version which you created the project or newer
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on the remote server â€” the latest LTS
- (Optional: HTTPS) An SSL Certificate

## Deploy your app

Set up SSL certificate

### (Optional) Set up SSL certificate for HTTPS

1. Put your certificate key in **sslcert/xxx.key.pem**, you are only able to change part xxx.
1. Put your certificate file in **sslcert/xxx.cert.pem**, you are only able to change part xxx.

### Build the project

```bash
sk build
```

1. Enter the name of the app
1. Enter the ip or the name of the remote server which you want to deploy your app
{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" >}}
We recommend to enter the name rather of the ip to make sure you don't have problem with certificate.
{{< /alert >}}
1. Enter the port of the remote server which you want to deploy your app
1. Select which hypertext transfer protocol do you want to use
{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" >}}
Select HTTPS requires you to make the optional step. This is recommended.
{{< /alert >}}
1. Select DOCKER when the CLI ask for manager

### Setup the folder on the remote server

1. Create a folder with the name of your choice in your server. Ex: my-awesome-app
1. Copy the dist folder in that folder
1. Edit database config in **.env** and **docker-compose.yml**

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" >}}
The database hostname in .env is the service name in docker compose. Ex: database_<project_name>.
{{< /alert >}}

```yaml
- MYSQL_ROOT_USER=root
- MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=
- MYSQL_USER=
- MYSQL_PASSWORD=
- MYSQL_DATABASE=
```

### Use Docker

We use docker to manage and keep our application online 24/7.

#### Start an app

In the dist folder, use the following command.

```bash
npm run docker:up
```

#### Managing process

You can use the following commands to manage your processes

```bash
npm run docker:build
npm run docker:up
npm run docker:down
npm run docker:logs
```

### Initialize the database in the docker container

1. Wait for the docker containers to boot up
{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" >}}
This can take up to 5min, execute 'npm run docker:logs' once this delay has passed.
{{< /alert >}}
1. Init the database
{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" >}}
Depends of the ORM in use, check examples below.
{{< /alert >}}

#### Ex: Prisma

```bash
# Enter docker container
docker compose exec <app_name> bash

# Classic
npx prisma db push
npx prisma db seed
or
# With migration
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma db seed

# Exit docker container
exit
```

### Go to the app

Well done ! Your app is now deployed and available at:

```url
http(s)://[the name or the ip of the server]:[port of the server]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Rights problem

Manually create the folder used in docker volumes and give it the good rights.
