## Requirements

- Working project â€” check that your project works locally
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on local computer and remote server â€” latest LTS version or newer
- [Skulljs-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@skulljs/cli) on local computer â€” the version you used to create the project or a newer version
- [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/pm2-doc-single-page/) globally installed on the remote server â€” latest LTS
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) on remote server â€” 8.0 version or newer
- (Optional: HTTPS) An SSL Certificate

## Deploy your app

Set up SSL certificate

### (Optional) Set up SSL certificate for HTTPS

1. Put your certificate key in **sslcert/xxx.key.pem**, you are only able to rename the **xxx** part.
1. Put your certificate file in **sslcert/xxx.cert.pem**, you are only able to rename the **xxx** part.

### Build the project

```bash
sk build
```

1. Enter the name of the app
1. Enter the ip address or the name of the remote server where you wish to deploy your application.
   {{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" >}}
   We recommend to enter the name rather than the ip address to make sure you don't encounter problems with certificates.
   {{< /alert >}}
1. Enter the port of the remote server where you wish to deploy your application.
1. Select which hypertext transfer protocol do you would like to use.
   {{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" >}}
   Selecting HTTPS requires you to make the optional step. This is recommended.
   {{< /alert >}}
1. Select PM2 when the CLI prompts you to select a manager

### Setup the folder on the remote server

1. Create a folder with the name of your choice in your server. Ex: my-awesome-app
1. Copy the dist folder in that folder
1. Install the dependencies with the following command

```bash
npm install
```

### Initialize the database on the remote server

1. Change the database configuration in the .env file
1. Init the database

   Actions may vary depending on the ORM being used. Please see below for examples.
   {{< /alert >}}

#### Ex: Prisma

```bash
# Classic
npx prisma db push
npx prisma db seed
or
# With migration
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma db seed
```

### Use PM2

The last step of the deployment is to setup PM2. We use PM2 to manage and keep our application online 24/7.

#### Start an app

In the dist folder, use the following command.

```bash
npm run pm2:start
```

#### Managing process

You can use the following commands to manage your processes.

```bash
npm run pm2:start
npm run pm2:stop
npm run pm2:restart
npm run pm2:reload
npm run pm2:delete
npm run pm2:logs
```

### Go to the app

Well done ! Your app is now deployed and available at:

```url
http(s)://[the name or the ip of the server]:[port of the server]
```
