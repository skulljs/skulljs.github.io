## Introduction

Documentation is an essential component of application development, and it provides an organized and easy-to-use guide for developers to understand and use the application effectively. Developer documentation, specifically, is designed to help other developers who are working on the same software to application how it works and how to modify or extend it.

That's why in Skulljs we have some built-in documentation tools.

## Compodoc

For Angular and NestJs documentation we use the open-souce tool named [Compodoc](https://compodoc.app/). You can generate the documentation wth the following command.

```bash
sk doc
```

## Open API

For the REST API documentation we use the [Open API](https://www.openapis.org/) specification and [Swagger](https://swagger.io/).
